# Recipe List Web Application

Playground project implementing a recipe list web app, built with [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), so its docs could be helpful for development.

## Features

- Simple list and controls interface for adding/removing items
- Search through existing elements capability with search-bar
- Local storage usage for maintaining data throughout all windows with the same domain

## Possible Extensions

- Build server and database to replace local storage
- Fetch existing recipes from public APIs (suggested: [Public Recipe APIs](https://rapidapi.com/blog/recipe-apis/))
- Dark theme switch button

# Quick Start

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

[Jest](https://jestjs.io/) is used for test running and assertions. [Enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/index.html) is used for Jest snapshots shallow rendering.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
